# Arcade Game
This game is like Frogger! If a bad object hits your player, the player restarts from position 1. If you can cross the grid without getting hit by a bad object, you win! YAY!

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon.
